Having helped budding developers for nearly 2 decades now, GSoC produces stellar SWEs who go on to work on big real world projects that impact thousands if not millions of users around the world. Some of it's previous contributors morph into bigger roles and can be seen working for FAANG. The [stipend](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) paid out is determined by the hours of work put in as well as the scope of the project. Taking purchasing power parity into consideration, stipends on the same task will differ based on country of residence; and this ranges from $750 - $6000.

4. ## [Hyperledger Mentorship Program]()

The primary goal of the Hyperledger Mentorship Program is to establish a well-structured, hands-on learning experience for new contributors who may not otherwise have the chance to participate in the Hyperledger open source development community. Prospective mentees will submit applications and be paired with mentors actively involved in the Hyperledger community, working remotely from their preferred locations. Ongoing assessment and feedback mechanisms will be in place, allowing mentees to showcase their progress and contributions through various channels such as blogging, speaking engagements at meetups or regional events, and the potential to attend a global Hyperledger event to present their work in person while networking with peers in the wider community. Similar to GSoC and GSoD the stipend is adjusted according to the country of residence of the mentees with purchasing power parity taken into consideration but ranges from $3000 - $6000.
