Outreachy provides paid internships in Open-Source, with a stipend of $7000 USD. It is beginner-friendly. 
Contributors have to go through a series of steps before being incorporated into the 3-month program. 
There are two intakes every year - May and December.

Outreachy is an internship initiative designed for individuals under-represented and marginalized in the field of technology. Its primary aim is to provide a platform for these groups to contribute to open-source projects, overcoming challenges they may encounter in their home countries. The program offers a stipend of USD 7000, distributed in two installments of USD 3000 and USD 4000. Prospective contributors need to navigate through several stages, starting with an initial application, followed by a contribution stage, and ultimately the internship itself. The duration between the initial application and the commencement of the internship spans three months. Outreachy conducts two application cycles annually, one in January for the May intake and another in August for the December intake.

Interested? Apply for the May 2024 intake. Check out the [Outreachy Applicant Guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/) to plan accordingly. The program runs for at least 3 months.

Google Summer of Code(GSoC) is a Google-managed open-source remote 'internship'. Having run for 19 years now, GSoC has been a haven for open-source contributions from developers all around the world. Having helped budding developers for nearly 2 decades now, GSoC produces stellar SWEs who go on to work on big real world projects that impact thousands if not millions of users around the world. Some of its previous contributors morph into bigger roles and can be seen working for FAANG. The [stipend](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) paid out is determined by the hours of work put in as well as the scope of the project. Taking purchasing power parity into consideration, stipends on the same task will differ based on country of residence; and this ranges from USD 750 - 6000.

![Success](/media/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-30%2021-19-21.png)
The primary goal of the Hyperledger Mentorship Program is to establish a well-structured, hands-on learning experience for new contributors who may not otherwise have the chance to participate in the Hyperledger open-source development community. Prospective mentees will submit applications and be paired with mentors actively involved in the Hyperledger community, working remotely from their preferred locations. Ongoing assessment and feedback mechanisms will be in place, allowing mentees to showcase their progress and contributions through various channels such as blogging, speaking engagements at meetups or regional events, and the potential to attend a global Hyperledger event to present their work in person while networking with peers in the wider community. Similar to GSoC and GSoD the stipend is adjusted according to the country of residence of the mentees with purchasing power parity taken into consideration but ranges from $3000 - $6000 USD. Visit their intern page to [learn more about the program](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN).

The internship/mentorship initiative within LF Networking (LFN) strives to establish a well-organized, hands-on learning experience for aspiring developers who might not otherwise have the chance to immerse themselves in open-source software development or become part of the technical communities associated with LFN projects. Additionally, it offers a clearer pathway for LFN projects to engage with the upcoming cohort of student developers, enhancing their developer base by infusing fresh talent. Mentees develop close working relations with professionals and industry business leaders. Coupled with that, they get to have hands-on experience with real-world projects that affect thousands of users. The stipend for this program is dependent on the mentees's country of residence, and this can be found [here](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentee-stipends/total-stipend-amount).
